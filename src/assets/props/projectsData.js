  text: "The human sundial project consists of an oval sundial approximately 25 feet by 18 feet in front of the Estes Park Memorial Observatory. The sundial gnomon (the part that casts the shadow) is fulfilled by a person standing on a tile corresponding to the current month. The person's shadow will then indicate the current standard time, not daylight savings time. Concrete pavers (bricks) are used to fill in and surround the sundial. The pavers are engraved with individual messages and sold to the public to support the observatory and its programs. The project is a cooperative effort between the observatory and the local Estes Park Noon Rotary Club. The Community Service Committee of the Rotary Club has collaborated with the observatory to build the sundial as part of their annual community service project. Bricks are $100 each with all profits going to support the observatory and school astronomy projects",
