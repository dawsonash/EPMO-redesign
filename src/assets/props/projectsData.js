  text: "The human sundial project consists of an oval sundial approximately 25 feet by 18 feet in front of the Estes Park Memorial Observatory. The sundial gnomon (the part that casts the shadow) is fulfilled by a person standing on a tile corresponding to the current month. The person's shadow will then indicate the current standard time, not daylight savings time. Concrete pavers (bricks) are used to fill in and surround the sundial. The pavers are engraved with individual messages and sold to the public to support the observatory and its programs. The project is a cooperative effort between the observatory and the local Estes Park Noon Rotary Club. The Community Service Committee of the Rotary Club has collaborated with the observatory to build the sundial as part of their annual community service project. Bricks are $100 each with all profits going to support the observatory and school astronomy projects",

  text: "BERT or the Bobcat Engineered Radio Telescope was inspired by high school student leader Storm Wolf. With it we hope to observe and map celestial objects such as the Crab Nebula and the Andromeda Galaxy using the radio spectrum. Thanks to the generous support of the local Masonic Lodge, the Estes Park Memorial Observatory, the Estes Valley Astronomical Society and the Toshiba America Foundation, funding for the telescope was obtained. Students from the high school were teamed with members of the local amateur radio club to help build the telescope. The HAM radio operators provided the necessary expertise for the construction and operation of the telescope.Radio signals are part of the electromagnetic spectrum (EM) along with light and are able to reach Earth and many large radio observatories have been built to look at objects through this portion of the EM spectrum. Radio radiation allows us to look at objects that emit relatively low energy. This includes dust and gases in the galaxy and solar system. The pictures below show the Milky Way galaxy in a 360 degree map view like opening a 3D globe of the Earth onto a flat 2D oval view on a sheet of paper. The view on the left is visible light captured with an optical telescope and a camera. The view on the right is radio radiation captured from a radio telescope at 408 Hz. This picture is a representations in false color (i.e.: made so we see the radio frequency of the electromagnetic spectrum as if it were visible light).",
